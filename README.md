# oxalorg's emacs configuration

This configuration is based off [Corgi](https://github.com/lambdaisland/corgi). 

Watch the entry video I made about this configuration at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q4UmX45ZlM

But recently I find myself spending more and more time in just emacs. This is a combination of 
1. Being less interested in shiny new things
2. More conscious focus on improving my 80% (code stuff) rather than my 20% (everything else in the unixy world)
3. Effort to make my computing environment minimal

I've been maintaining a [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/oxalorg/dotfiles) over the years.

I've extracted this .emacs.d from that repo: https://github.com/oxalorg/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs.d

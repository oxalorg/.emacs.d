# oxalorg's emacs configuration

I've been maintaining a [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/oxalorg/dotfiles) over the years.

But recently I find myself spending more and more time in just emacs. This is a combination of 
1. Being less interested in shiny new things
2. More conscious focus on improving my 80% (code stuff) rather than my 20% (everything else in the unixy world)
3. Effort to make my computing environment minimal

## Special thanks

Since I spend most of my time in Clojure and Clojurescript this configuration is mostly geared towards it.

I've used the amazing set of emacs packages by @plexus called as [Corgi](https://github.com/lambdaisland/corgi) and [Corgi-packages](https://github.com/lambdaisland/corgi-packages) as a base to develop my personal config off of.
